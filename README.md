# dFBApy

A module for acquiring kinetic parameters and executing GEM dFBA is defined. 

### dynamic-FBA
The aforementioned kinetic parameters are parameterized into a dynamic FBA simulation of the corresponding GEM. The core script is formulated around Cobrapy, and generates a descriptive dataframe of metabolic concentrations with each timestep that can be externally investigated and visualized.
